# Analysis-of-Public-Sentiment-of-Shanghai-Disneyland

Hello, here is the project that my partner and I completed for ECON7890 Foundations in Big Data Analytics: Programming during the MSc in Data Analytics & Business Economics program at Hong Kong Baptist university.

This project refers to the crawler project code (https://blog.csdn.net/Spratumn/article/details/100853846) published by Spratumn in the CSDN community.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project is in the context of the Shanghai Disney Tickets Increasing Incident that caused widespread public discussions on Shanghai Disney in December 2019. 
The purpose of this project is to build a  primary semantic analysis AI of affective attitudes on target topics that can automatically identify Weibo's emotional attitudes by collecting Weibos with different emotional attitudes to Shanghai Disney.
